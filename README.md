# Pokémon Platinum but Moves Get Worse

This is a romhack based off of the pret pokemon platinum decomp. The premise is that every time pp is decuted from a move, its accuracy/power are reduced.
The mod has configurable settings via the #defines at the top of move_data.c if you'd like to turn off either power/accuracy or adjust the amount by which they are reduced per pp.

Patchfile coming soon, please watch for it on the Releases Page.

This is based off of Pret's WIP decompilation of Pokémon Platinum. Please consult them for releavnt info. 
For instructions on how to set up the repository, please read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
